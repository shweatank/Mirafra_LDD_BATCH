Interrupt:
An interrupt is signal or a disturbance to a process whenver interrupts occur 
it stops the current running process and and points PC to next instruction and
pushed PC to stack and it start executing ISR after serves an response to ISR 
again PC pop from stack and process continues from PC.

What is an ISR or Interrup Handler ?
It is a function which invokes when any interrupts comes from hardware or software.

What happens when the any Interrupt came ?
steps :
Interrupt->IRQ->NVIC->VIT->ISR---->again back to the program


What is polling ?
It is a process which continuously check the status...flag based.

Interrup & Exception

Interrupt - Asynchronous interrupt generated by hardware.
eg : push_button,uart interrupt.

Exception - Synchronous interrupt generated by software.
eg. num/0 ->floating point exception,ctrl+z

e – All Interrupt Requests (IRQs) issued by I/O devices give rise to maskable interrupts. A maskable interrupt can be in two states: masked or unmasked; a masked interrupt is ignored by the control unit as long as it remains masked.

Non-maskable – Only a few critical events (such as hardware failures) give rise to nonmaskable interrupts. Non-maskable interrupts are always recognized by the CPU.
